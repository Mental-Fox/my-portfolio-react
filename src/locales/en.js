      title: "Term Example",
      content: `
      For example, if a Tele2 operator's base station fails in the Almaty region, 
      an engineer opens an OSS system, such as Huawei U2000 or Ericsson ENM, and sees:
    - The equipment is not responding;
    - Which alarms (errors) have been triggered;
    - How many subscribers are affected.
    Through the same system, they can:
    - Remotely reboot the equipment;
    - Adjust settings (e.g., rotate the antenna by 10Â°);
    - Run a script to collect load statistics.`,
